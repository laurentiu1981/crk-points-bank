        ol
          li Connect your Points Bank account securely via OAuth
          li Grant permission for payment processing with points
          li Shop anywhere and automatically redeem points at checkout
          li Earn points on every purchase and track your balance
        p.note
          strong Note:
          | Card linking creates a secure, non-expiring token that allows us to process point transactions on your behalf. You can revoke access anytime from your Points Bank member dashboard.
